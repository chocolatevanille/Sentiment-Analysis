# YouTube Sentiment Analysis

Ever since YouTube hid the Dislike feature from viewers, users have tried other ways to 
assess the general sentiment of the community when opening videos. This program will provide 
an alternative by determining whether the comments are generally positive, negative, or neutral. 

This project is in production. Status: Model trained and saved. Next step: Creating a way to scrape 
YT comments and import them to be analyzed. 

Key Tools: PyTorch, Docker, JupyterLab, Transformers, Pandas, Keras
